# ed-hub-LMS
In Sri Lanka, the education sector plays a major role in building up the skills of people from their childhood. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis in the country, schools can't continue their process in the physical and traditional ways. Ed-hub Learning Management System is a web-based application that can be used to continue junior-secondary level classes online. When comes to online schools, improving the academic and non-academic skills of students is a major problem. Due to a lack of computer literacy, boosting the teaching process and managing processes of the school are also the main problems. The relationship between the school and the parents should also be improved. The study is aimed to implement Ed-hub Learning Management System to continue learning, teaching, and managing processes in the junior-secondary level of Sri Lankan schools during pandemic or crisis situations. To fulfill the aim, primary and secondary research should be done to gather and analyze requirements. Then a feasibility study should be done to determine the viability of the project. After that, a project plan should be created using the Gantt chart and Work Breakdown Structure. Physical design, architectural design, and the interface of the system should be designed using the appropriate diagrams and tools. Then the system should be implemented using relevant programming languages. The application should be tested, and fixed the bugs and errors. In the end, the system should be presented to the consumers. Ed-hub Learning Management System will be a good solution for junior-secondary level classes in Sri Lankan schools to continue their schooling process online.
